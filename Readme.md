# 🧠 MCP Server – AI Tool for Posting on X (Twitter)

This project allows you to create a **custom AI-powered tool** that can generate and directly **post content to X (formerly Twitter)** using natural language instructions.

Instead of writing posts manually, you can interact with the AI by giving simple commands like:

> “Post a funny one-liner about Monday mornings.”

The AI understands the instruction, generates relevant content, and publishes it to your X account through the API.
