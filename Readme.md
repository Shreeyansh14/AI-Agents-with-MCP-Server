# ðŸ¤– AI-Agents-with-MCP-Server

A simulation of a distributed multi-agent system where AI agents operate within a grid-based environment and communicate using the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**. This protocol governs structured communication between agents and the central server to coordinate movement, avoid conflicts, and achieve shared goals in the environment.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Autonomous Agents**: Multiple agents explore the grid and interact using the MCP protocol.
- **MCP-Based Communication**: All interactions follow a structured protocol defining agent messages, states, and environment updates.
- **Grid Environment**: Configurable 2D space with optional obstacles and position tracking.
- **Conflict Resolution**: Prevents agents from overlapping by context-aware command dispatch.
- **Centralized Coordination**: A server maintains shared context and governs protocol flow between agents.
